You can of course ask LLM to explain in greater depths specific commands, but still try to write them yourself in the exercises! LLMs will become useful to write code during your programming journey, but you first need to understand the core concepts of Python, which will take quite some time! So, please try the exercises and make as many mistakes as possible! The cool thing about programming is that you can just try things out until they work, which you can see immediately!"
