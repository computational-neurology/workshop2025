You can of course copy/paste them into an LLM and solve them, but it won't be helpful for you at this stage. You can of course ask LLM to explain in greater depths specific commands, but still try to write them yourself in the exercises! LLMs will become useful to write code during your programming journey, but you first need to understand the core concepts of Python, which will take quite some time! So, please try the exercises and make as many mistakes as possible! The cool thing about programming is that you can just try things out until they work, which you can see immediately!"

        "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
        "A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's a great tool for data analysis, scientific research, and learning to code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Cells\n",
        "There are mainly two types of cells in Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
        "1. **Code cells**: These cells contain code that can be executed.\n",
        "2. **Markdown cells**: These cells contain text formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows you to format the text in various ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Creating and Running Cells\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Creating a Code Cell**: To create a new code cell, click on the \"+\" button in the toolbar or use the keyboard shortcut `B` to insert a cell below the current cell. Type your code in the new cell and press `Shift + Enter` to run it.\n",
        "- **Creating a Markdown Cell**: To create a markdown cell, first create a new cell as above, then use the keyboard shortcut `M` to change a cell to markdown. Type your text using Markdown syntax and press `Shift + Enter` to render it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Adding Cells Above and Below\n",

        "Here are some basic Markdown examples:\n",
        "- **Headings**: Create headings by starting a line with one (for H1), two (for H2), or more `#` characters, followed by a space.\n",
        "- **Bold and Italics**: Use `**` or `__` for **bold** text and `*` or `_` for *italic* text.\n",
        "- **Lists**: Create bullet lists using `*`, `+`, or `-`, followed by a space. Create numbered lists using numbers followed by a period.\n",
        "- **Links**: Create links using `[link text](URL)`."
